# IT-360-PROJECT-NETWORK-LOGGER
Our tools name is called WhereApp and it is a messaging platform that doubles as a digital forensics logging tool. It lets users chat in real time while the backend captures and stores encrypted messages along with forensic metadata, including usernames, IP addresses, and MAC addresses, IP addresses, and IV.
The UI for the website was coded in HTML and the actual network logger was coded in bash. The messaging website displays active users, has a login feature, and contains typing bubbles when someone is chatting.
